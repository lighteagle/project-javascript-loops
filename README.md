# Project JavaScript Loops

- Put some variety of data (`string`, `number`, `array`, `object`) inside variables. You can later `console.log` or `alert` the variable values.
  - Such as people names, array of numbers, phone numbers, addresses, city names, country names, etc
- Use loop statements, such as `do {} while ()` or `for ()`
- You can also use comparison operators, such as `>`, `<`, `===`, `!==`
- You can also use conditional statements, such as `if else` and `switch case`
